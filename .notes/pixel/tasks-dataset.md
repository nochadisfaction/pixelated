### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` or `python -m pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests
- The pipeline uses both existing local datasets and external HuggingFace datasets
- Voice processing requires yt-dlp and Whisper for transcription
