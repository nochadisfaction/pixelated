### Notes

- **ALWAYS** make sure your Python environment is activated before running any commands.
- 'pixel' is the name of the conda environment you should be in.
- 'conda activate pixel' to activate the environment.
- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `python -m pytest ai/pixel/` to run all Pixel-related tests
- Training infrastructure requires 8x A100 GPUs minimum for full-scale training
- Psychology knowledge extraction leverages existing ai/1.PsychologyTest/ resources
- Voice processing utilizes existing ai/youtube-transcription-pipeline/ infrastructure
- MERTools integration provides emotion recognition foundation.
