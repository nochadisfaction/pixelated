**Summary of Changes:**
A new TypeScript module, `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/analyzers/depressionAnalyzer.ts`, was created. This module provides functionality to analyze input text for indicators of depression using the MentalLLaMA models. It includes:
*   Defined interfaces for `DepressionAnalysisInput` and `DepressionAnalysisResult`.
*   The core `analyzeDepression` async function that takes text, interacts with a MentalLLaMA provider (assumed `mental-llama-13b`), and uses a specialized depression prompt (assumed to be available).
*   Logic for handling empty input, provider errors, LLM errors, and response parsing errors.
*   Structured logging (assuming a shared `logger`) for key events and errors, with attention to PII.
*   The output includes a boolean for depression indicators, confidence score, severity, identified specific indicators, and an LLM-generated explanation.
*   The implementation assumes prompts are designed to return structured JSON for easier parsing and includes a schema for this in the prompt call.

**Files Modified:**
*   **Created:** `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/analyzers/depressionAnalyzer.ts`
*   **Updated:** `.notes/in-progress/mentalllama-integration.mdx` (task marked complete, progress updated)

**UI/UX Impact (if applicable):**
This is a backend component. Its primary impact on UI/UX will be through the quality and structure of the depression analysis data it provides to any front-end features that will consume it. Clear, accurate, and well-explained results are crucial for a good user experience.

**Potential Impacts/Next Steps (if any):**
*   The newly created analyzer needs to be integrated into the broader system that will call it (e.g., an API endpoint or another service).
*   The assumed paths for `getMentalLLaMAProvider`, `getDepressionPrompt`, `logger`, and `MentalLLaMATypes` need to be verified and adjusted if incorrect.
*   Robust JSON parsing and validation (e.g., using Zod) for the LLM response should be implemented as noted in the code comments.
*   Unit and integration tests should be written for this analyzer.
*   The next logical tasks could be implementing other specialized analyzers (e.g., for anxiety) or integrating this analyzer.

**Security Considerations Addressed:**
*   Input Handling: Basic check for empty input.
*   Error Handling: Implemented try-catch blocks for robustness against provider, LLM, and parsing errors.
*   Logging: Included PII handling considerations in comments and structured logging to aid secure operations.
*   Dependencies: Relies on secure interaction with the MentalLLaMA provider and prompt system.
*   Output: The structured output is sensitive (mental health data) and must be handled securely by consuming systems.

**(If applicable) Pre-existing Issues Noted:**
*   None noted during this task.

**(If applicable) Linter Status:**
*   The generated code follows common TypeScript and clean code practices. Any project-specific linter configurations would need to be run to confirm compliance. No new linter errors are anticipated from the structure of the generated code.
