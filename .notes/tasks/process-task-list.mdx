# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Ollama Overlord
baseURL = https://api.pixelatedempathy.com
Call and ask for granite3.3:2b
Share your update, and ask for permission to continue moving forward

## Ollama Overlord Check-in Protocol

- After completing each sub-task, the agent MUST:
  1. Send a POST request to the Ollama API at https://api.pixelatedempathy.com/api/generate
  2. Use the model: granite3.3:2b
  3. Use this enhanced prompt:
     ```
     You are an AI project oversight system reviewing task completion progress. Based on the task summary provided, please:

     1. Provide 1-3 specific improvement ideas for the completed task (focus on code quality, architecture, testing, documentation, or implementation approach)
     2. Decide whether the project should continue to the next task

     Response format:
     IMPROVEMENTS:
     - [Improvement idea 1]
     - [Improvement idea 2] (if applicable)
     - [Improvement idea 3] (if applicable)

     DECISION: [yes/no]

     Task completed: <summary>

     Remember:
     - Always suggest improvements unless the task is perfect
     - Only say "no" if there are critical errors, failures, or security issues
     - Consider maintainability, scalability, and best practices
     - Be constructive and specific in your suggestions
     ```
     (Replace `<summary>` with a brief description of the completed sub-task.)
  4. Parse Ollama's response to extract improvement suggestions and the yes/no decision
  5. If improvements are suggested, evaluate each one and decide whether to add it as a new task
  6. If the decision is "yes" or "y", proceed to the next sub-task
  7. If the decision is "no", halt and report to the user
- The agent MUST NOT proceed to the next sub-task without receiving "yes" or "y" from the Ollama model.

**Note:**  
- This protocol replaces any human check-in step.  
- The agent should log each check-in and response for traceability.

### Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the ollama overlord for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- Address linter errors and warnings as they appear.
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.
- Always stop before marking complete and do a second look over your work, and clean up any linter errors or warnings.

### Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

### AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for ollama overlord approval.
