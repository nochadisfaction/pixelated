# Proposed Tasks and Improvements

## Integration Testing Task (1.7.2) - Ollama Overlord Suggestions

### High-Priority Improvements
- **AWESOME** Review the test results: Analyze the outcomes of integration tests to identify any discrepancies or failures that need to be addressed
- **AWESOME** Performance optimization: Use the test results to identify bottlenecks in the system's performance and optimize the model and related components where necessary
- Debugging: If there are issues with the tests, pinpoint and resolve them through refined model architecture, testing code, or component interactions
- Update documentation: Document the test cases and their expected outcomes for future reference and maintenance

### Security and Scalability
- Security assessment: Ensure that integration tests include checks for security vulnerabilities, such as potential data leaks or attacks on model inputs
- **AWESOME** Scalability testing: Validate whether the model can handle increased workloads without significant degradation in performance

### Collaboration and Iteration
- Collaborate with peers: Share findings and discuss challenges encountered during test development and execution for valuable insights and innovative solutions
- Iterate based on feedback: Incorporate suggestions from team members, supervisors, or peer reviews to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of integration tests

### Additional Recommendations
- Implement continuous integration testing pipeline
- Add automated performance regression detection
- Create comprehensive test coverage reports
- Develop stress testing scenarios for extreme workloads
