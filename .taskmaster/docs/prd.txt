# Product Requirements Document: Bias Detection Engine Production Upgrade

## Introduction/Overview

The Pixelated Empathy Bias Detection Engine currently exists as a rough draft with incomplete implementations, missing components, and various bugs. This upgrade will transform it into a complete, production-grade system that ensures fair and equitable AI-assisted therapeutic training across all demographic groups. The system must be fully functional with no placeholders, comprehensive error handling, and seamless integration capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Complete Implementation**: Deliver a fully functional bias detection engine with all components implemented and working
2. **Production Quality**: Achieve enterprise-grade reliability, performance, and maintainability
3. **Zero Technical Debt**: Eliminate all linter errors, warnings, and code quality issues
4. **Compliance Ready**: Ensure HIPAA and SOC2 compliance from day one
5. **Serverless Architecture**: Design for serverless deployment with optimal performance
6. **Future Integration Ready**: Prepare for seamless integration with the therapy chat system

## User Stories

1. **As a system administrator**, I want to monitor bias detection in real-time so that I can ensure fair treatment across all demographic groups
2. **As a compliance officer**, I want comprehensive audit logs and reports so that I can demonstrate HIPAA and SOC2 compliance
3. **As a developer**, I want clean, well-documented APIs so that I can integrate bias detection into other systems
4. **As a data scientist**, I want detailed bias metrics and analytics so that I can improve our AI models
5. **As a therapist trainer**, I want bias alerts during training sessions so that I can address issues immediately
6. **As a platform user**, I want the system to work reliably without downtime so that my training sessions are uninterrupted

## Functional Requirements

### Core Engine Requirements
1. The system must implement a complete 4-layer bias detection framework (preprocessing, model-level, interactive, evaluation)
2. The system must integrate with all specified toolkits: IBM AIF360, Microsoft Fairlearn, Google What-If Tool, Hugging Face evaluate, spaCy, and NLTK
3. The system must analyze therapeutic sessions in under 100ms for real-time feedback
4. The system must support 100+ concurrent session analyses
5. The system must provide configurable bias thresholds (warning: 0.3, high: 0.6, critical: 0.8)
6. The system must generate actionable recommendations for bias mitigation

### API Requirements
7. The system must provide RESTful APIs for session analysis, dashboard data, and data export
8. The system must support JSON, CSV, and PDF export formats
9. The system must implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
10. The system must validate all input data and provide clear validation errors
11. The system must support real-time WebSocket connections for live monitoring

### Dashboard Requirements
12. The system must provide a React-based real-time monitoring dashboard
13. The system must display bias trends, alerts, and demographic breakdowns
14. The system must support filtering by time range and demographic groups
15. The system must auto-refresh every 30 seconds with manual refresh capability
16. The system must provide interactive charts and visualizations

### Data & Security Requirements
17. The system must implement HIPAA-compliant data handling with encryption at rest and in transit
18. The system must provide comprehensive audit logging for all operations
19. The system must mask sensitive demographic data in logs and exports
20. The system must implement SOC2 Type II controls for data access and processing
21. The system must support data retention policies and automated cleanup

### Integration Requirements
22. The system must integrate with Supabase authentication
23. The system must provide TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
24. The system must support serverless deployment (Vercel/Netlify functions)
25. The system must be prepared for future therapy chat system integration
26. The system must provide comprehensive SDK for external integrations

### Performance Requirements
27. The system must handle 1000+ requests per minute without degradation
28. The system must implement proper caching for frequently accessed data
29. The system must optimize database queries for sub-second response times
30. The system must implement graceful degradation during high load

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Custom ML Model Training**: Will use existing pre-trained models from the specified toolkits
2. **Video/Audio Analysis**: Focus on text-based bias detection only
3. **Multi-language Support**: English language support only for initial release
4. **Custom Authentication**: Will integrate with existing Supabase auth
5. **Mobile App**: Web-based dashboard only
6. **Historical Data Migration**: New system starts fresh

## Design Considerations

- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript, using existing Pixelated Empathy design system
- **Component Library**: Leverage existing UI components (shadcn/ui)
- **Charts**: Use Recharts for data visualizations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly dashboard interface
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all UI components

## Technical Considerations

- **Backend**: Python Flask API for ML processing, TypeScript for business logic
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Caching**: Redis for session caching and real-time data
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend, serverless functions for API
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and performance monitoring
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality**: Zero linter errors, 90%+ test coverage
2. **Performance**: <100ms average response time, 99.9% uptime
3. **Compliance**: Pass all HIPAA and SOC2 audit requirements
4. **User Experience**: <2 second dashboard load time, real-time updates
5. **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing Pixelated Empathy systems
6. **Maintainability**: Complete documentation, clear code structure
