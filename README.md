## üöÄ Reimagining Mental Healthcare

**Pixelated Empathy** is not just another digital health platform‚Äîit's a paradigm shift in how we approach mental wellbeing.

By harnessing the transformative power of artificial intelligence and deep emotional understanding, we've created an ecosystem that empowers practitioners to deliver unprecedented care while maintaining the human connection that makes therapy effective.

> "The future of mental healthcare isn't about replacing therapists with technology‚Äîit's about enhancing human insight with data-driven clarity."

## üß† The Intelligence Layer for Mental Health Professionals

Pixelated Empathy functions as an invisible companion throughout the therapeutic journey, analyzing patterns, detecting nuances, and providing insights that might otherwise remain hidden.

### Real-time Therapeutic Analytics

Our platform processes therapeutic conversations in real-time, identifying emotional states, cognitive patterns, and potential concerns that can inform treatment strategies:

- **Emotion Recognition** ‚Äî Detect subtle shifts in emotional expression
- **Pattern Identification** ‚Äî Recognize behavioral trends over time
- **Risk Assessment** ‚Äî Identify potential warning signs early
- **Intervention Suggestions** ‚Äî Receive AI-powered therapeutic direction

## üîí Privacy by Design, Security by Default

In an era of data exploitation, Pixelated Empathy stands apart with a fundamentally different approach to sensitive information.

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Our platform employs cutting-edge cryptographic methods that enable advanced analysis without ever exposing raw data:

- **End-to-End Encryption** ‚Äî Military-grade protection for all communications
- **Federated Processing** ‚Äî Data never leaves secure environments
- **Privacy-Preserving ML** ‚Äî Analytics without exposure
- **Ethical AI Frameworks** ‚Äî Transparent, explainable, and accountable

## ‚ö° The Pixelated Empathy Difference

| **Traditional Approaches** | **Pixelated Empathy** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Manual session notes | AI-assisted documentation |
| Intuition-based insights | Data-driven pattern recognition |
| Lagging intervention | Proactive support identification |
| Basic client tracking | Comprehensive progress analytics |
| Isolated practice knowledge | Collective intelligence framework |
| Standard security | Military-grade encryption |
| Technical complexity | Seamless user experience |

## üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Information

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

#### Image Format Errors

If you encounter the following error during build:

```
Error: Input file contains unsupported image format
   at Sharp.metadata (/node_modules/.pnpm/sharp@0.33.5/node_modules/sharp/lib/input.js:487:17)
```

We've implemented an automatic solution:

1. Use `pnpm build` to run the build process
2. The build process automatically identifies and fixes problematic image files
3. Fixed images are stored in the `problematic-images-backup` directory

For more details, see the [scripts documentation](./scripts/README.md).

### MentalLLaMA Integration

The project includes an integration with MentalLLaMA, a specialized large language model for mental health analysis. The integration provides:

- **Advanced Mental Health Analysis**: Detection and analysis of depression, anxiety, stress, suicidal ideation, and PTSD indicators
- **Clinical Context Awareness**: Specialized prompt templates for different clinical scenarios (intake, crisis, therapy, monitoring, assessment)
- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Identification of supporting evidence for mental health conclusions with confidence scoring
- **Privacy-Focused Design**: Local model deployment with strong privacy protections for sensitive health information

#### Prompt Engineering Framework

The MentalLLaMA integration includes a sophisticated prompt engineering framework:

- **Main Prompt Template System:** [`prompts.ts`](src/lib/ai/mental-llama/prompts.ts)
- **Clinical Scenario Templates:**
  - [`anxiety-therapy.json`](src/lib/ai/mental-llama/templates/clinical/anxiety-therapy.json)
  - [`depression-crisis.json`](src/lib/ai/mental-llama/templates/clinical/depression-crisis.json)

1. **Tiered Prompt Architecture**
   - System Role Definition: Establishes mental health expertise
   - Task Specification: Defines the analysis parameters
   - Examples: Provides few-shot learning samples
   - Strategic Reminders: Guides the model toward key considerations
   - Context & Specifications: Tailors the analysis to specific needs

2. **Clinical Scenario Templates**
   - Specialized templates for different clinical contexts (crisis, therapy, etc.)
   - Category-specific analysis parameters (depression, anxiety, etc.)
   - Optimized for accurate detection of subtle indicators

3. **Evaluation & Refinement System**
   - Comprehensive test datasets for each mental health category
   - Metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confidence
   - Automated refinement techniques for iterative improvement

4. **CLI Tools for Testing**
   - [`test-clinical-scenarios.ts`](src/lib/ai/mental-llama/cli/test-clinical-scenarios.ts): Test prompt templates in clinical scenarios
   - [`batch-evaluate.ts`](src/lib/ai/mental-llama/cli/batch-evaluate.ts): Run batch evaluations of multiple prompts
   - [`test-prompts.ts`](src/lib/ai/mental-llama/cli/test-prompts.ts): Test and evaluate prompt templates
   - [`run-template-test.sh`](src/lib/ai/mental-llama/scripts/run-template-test.sh): Script for testing all templates with sample inputs
