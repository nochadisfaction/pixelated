PROMPT="You are an AI project oversight system reviewing task completion progress. Based on the task summary provided, please:

1. Provide 1-3 specific improvement ideas for the completed task (focus on code quality, architecture, testing, documentation, or implementation approach)
2. Decide whether the project should continue to the next task

Response format:
IMPROVEMENTS:
- [Improvement idea 1]
- [Improvement idea 2] (if applicable)
- [Improvement idea 3] (if applicable)

DECISION: [yes/no]

Task completed: $TASK_SUMMARY

Remember:
- Always suggest improvements unless the task is perfect
- Only say \"no\" if there are critical errors, failures, or security issues
- Consider maintainability, scalability, and best practices
- Be constructive and specific in your suggestions"
